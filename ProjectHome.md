A clean Spring, Hibernate integration. An effort to let every Java developer understand the internals of Spring 3 including Spring's marvelous support for AOP, Transactions, MVC and how it can be easily integrated with a widely adopted relational persistence solution known as Hibernate.

This project shows all this stuff in action. To have a detailed explanation, you can read my series of 3-part blog posts on this project beginning from [here](http://nabeelalimemon.blogspot.com/2010/05/spring-3-integrated-with-hibernate-part.html).

In future, I plan to integrate more new Spring MVC stuff and maybe GWT for client side. Everything that i'll add to this project's source will be reflected on [my blog](http://nabeelalimemon.blogspot.com) posts.
